# Polaroids Third
Polaroids Third - a custom patreon rewards management system for the [Safety Third podcast Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/safetythird).

This project is simple - William Osman needs [custom software to manage his nightmare Patreon tier](https://youtu.be/6SOiZSGtdGI?t=274). I need a ~~5 hour~~ weekend project because I am bad at time planning.

The podcast has a patreon tier where a podcast member sends out a signed polaroid every third month to a patreon. This project creates a page that grabs all members of the patreon from the patreon API, and shows a webpage that lists out when each patron should have their polaroid sent out.

I've taken "3 months" to mean 180 days, because screw working with dates.

## Possible future features

Note: I probably won't take suggestions unless you have more than 2.66 million subscribers on YouTube (Sorry Allen/Peter)

Here are some things I *could* add if they were needed:
* Ability to mark if you've sent a patron a polaroid
* Proper login system to make this publicly hostable on the interwebs (instead of a locally hosted thing)
* A way to mark which podcast member is supposed to send the polaroid (on a rotating basis)

**Common sense warning**  
This project is clearly a very quickly thrown together thing, and I'm a random dude from the internets. Please read the code before doing something unwise, like plugging your Patreon API key or logging in via OAuth into a random nodejs project you got off of github.

Also, I take no liability if your house burns down as a result of my code. The [license](https://github.com/rsedivy/polaroids_third/blob/main/LICENSE) has more info on this.
