# Polaroids Third
Polaroids Third - a custom patreon rewards management system for the [Safety Third podcast Patreon page](https://www.patreon.com/safetythird).

This project is simple - William Osman needs [custom software to manage his nightmare Patreon tier](https://youtu.be/6SOiZSGtdGI?t=274). I need a 5 hour project because I have nothing to do on this Friday night.

The podcast has a patreon tier where a member gets a signed polaroid from a podcast member every 3 months. This project creates a page that grabs all members of the patreon from the patreon API, and shows a webpage that lists out when each patron should have their polaroid sent out.

There might be more features added in the future if someone needs them.

**Common sense warning**
This project is clearly a very quickly thrown together thing, and I'm a random dude from the internets. Please read the code before doing something unwise, like plugging your Patreon API key into a random nodejs project you got off of github.
